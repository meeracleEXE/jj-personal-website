        <p>I am a driven aspiring Software and Web Developer!
            I am currently studying at the University of Georgia, Athens and I am graduating December 2023.
            I have taken an interest in creating websites and software solutions that are not only functional
            and efficient, but also pleasing to the eye and attention-catching. The languages and tools I use 
            most often are Java, React, and GitHub. Take a look at my <a href='#project-section'>projects</a>! 
        </p>
        <p>
        My strongest trait is adaptability, this is due to the vast array of cultural <a href='#exp-section'>experiences</a> I have as a Malaysian International Student in the US and having done a year of cultural exchange in Germany. Not only culturally, but professionally, I have also grown to be able to lead teams of different peers to achieve project requirements with excellent results. </p>
        <p>
        I am also extremely meticulous and passionate about my work. This can be seen in my excellent academic achievements as well as the overall extremely positive feedback I have been given from my tutees from my 1 year+ experience as a Computer Science Peer Tutor.
